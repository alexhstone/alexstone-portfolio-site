# alexstone-site

Welcome to my portfolio site!  I made this site to show off a bit of my personality and showcase some of the projects I've worked on. 

The portfolio page pulls from the GitHub API to get an always-up-to-date list of my public repos. 

I also used a few breakpoints to ensure that this site works great on mobile.  So if you're on a desktop, make sure you check it out on a phone, too!
